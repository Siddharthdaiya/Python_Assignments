    "# How to perform pattern matching in Python?\n",
    "# Python provides a module referred as re for performing pattern matching using regular expression operations. \n",
    "# It provides many different functions that allows you to check if a particular string matches a given regular expression.\n",
    "# Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings (str) as well as 8-bit strings (bytes). \n",
    "# However, We cannot take combination of Unicode strings and 8-bit strings.\n",
    "# Similarly, while doing substitution, the replacement string must be of the same type as both the pattern and the search string.\n",
    "# The python's raw string notation is used for regular expression patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "# There are five different functions provided in re module to perform pattern matching. They are as listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using re.search() Function\n",
    "# Using re.match() Function\n",
    "# Using re.fullmatch() Function\n",
    "# Using re.findall() Function\n",
