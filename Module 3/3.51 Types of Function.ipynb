    "What are the types of Functions in Python?\n",
    "Functions are the basic building block of any Python program, defined as the organized block of reusable code, which can be called whenever required.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is used to carry out a specific task. The function might require multiple inputs. When the task is done executing, the function can or can not return one or more values.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of functions in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "User-Defined Functions - these types of functions are defined by the user to perform any specific task\n",
    "Built-in Functions - These are pre-defined functions in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in Functions\n",
    "Built-in functions are already defined in python. A user has to remember the name and parameters of a particular function. Since these functions are pre-defined, there is no need to define them again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the widely used built-in functions are given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "l = [2, 5, 19, 7, 43]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Length of string is\",len(l))\n",
    "print(\"Maximum number in list is \",max(l))\n",
    "print(\"Type is\",type(l))\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the widely used python built-in functions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Function\tDescription\n",
    "len()\tReturns the length of a python object\n",
    "abs()\tReturns the absolute value of a number\n",
    "max()\tReturns the largest item in a python iterable\n",
    "min()\tReturns the largest item in a python iterable\n",
    "sum()\tSum() in Python returns the sum of all the items in an iterator\n",
    "type()\tThe type() in Python returns the type of a python object\n",
    "help()\tExecutes the python built-in interactive help console\n",
    "input()\tAllows the user to give input\n",
    "format()\tFormats a specified value\n",
    "bool()\tReturns the boolean value of an object\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "User-Defined Functions\n",
    "These functions are defined by a programmer to perform any specific task\n",
    "or to reduce the complexity of big problems and use that function according to their need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def sub(x, y):\n",
    "    return x-y\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sub(5,2))\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "3\n",
    "In the above program, we have created our program that subtracts two numbers passed as arguments and displays the result.\n",
    "Such types of functions are known as user-defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of functions in Python\n",
    "Helps in increasing modularity of code – Functions in python help the user to divide the program into smaller parts and solve them individually, thus making it easier to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimizes Redundancy – Python functions help us to save the effort of rewriting the whole code. All we got to do is call the function once it is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximizes Code Reusability – Once a function is defined in python, it can be called as many times as needed, thus enhancing code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improves Clarity of Code – Since a large program is divided into sections with the help of functions, it helps increase the readability of code while ensuring easy debugging."
