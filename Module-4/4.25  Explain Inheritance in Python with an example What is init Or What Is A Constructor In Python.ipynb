    "# Inheritance relationship defines the classes that inherit from other classes as derived,\n",
    "# subclass, or sub-type classes. Base class remains to be the source from which a subclass inherits.\n",
    "# For example, you have a Base class of “Animal,” and a “Lion” is a Derived class. The inheritance will be Lion is an Animal.  \n",

    "# So, the question is, what does the “Lion” class inherit from “Animal”? \n",

    "#     known as the Liskov substitution principle. It indicates that if a computer program has object P as the subtype of Q,\n",
    "#     you can easily replace P with Q without altering the properties. \n",

    "# The __init__ method is the Python equivalent of the C++ constructor in an object-oriented approach.\n",
    "# The __init__ function is called every time an object is created from a class. \n",
    "# The __init__ method lets the class initialize the object's attributes and serves no other purpose. \n",
